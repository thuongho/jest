15. Demo and Start Click Counter
App

npx create-react-app clicker

16. Set up Enzyme and Write Tests

remove react-dom and add enzyme {shallow}
import adapter
configure enzyme with the adapter
- just letting enzyme know that we are going to use react 16
- that is what it is going to take as raw material to create react DOM 

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new EnzymeAdapter() })

renders without an error
- good basic test for any component

test anything that is critical to the app
core to the app
renders increment button

renders counter display

test the state
counter starts at 0

functionality
clicking button increments counter display

17. Test Component Rendering

React is moving towards functional components and using hooks and context instead of state

convert functional component into a class component
- use data test attribute
- we want to make sure that this attribute is here for testing and that it should not be changed

<div data-test=""></div>
